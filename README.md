Project Name: Stock Price Prediction and Analysis

Overview:
This project aims to develop a comprehensive tool for forecasting and analyzing stock prices, leveraging machine learning techniques and technical analysis indicators. By combining LSTM models for short-term price prediction with technical indicators such as Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), the system provides users with actionable insights into stock market trends, aiding in informed decision-making regarding investments.

Features:

LSTM Forecasting: Utilizes LSTM models to predict stock prices over the next month based on historical price data and machine learning algorithms.
Visual Representation: Utilizes Matplotlib to visualize both actual and predicted closing prices, offering users insights into the stock's price movements over time.
Technical Analysis: Calculates technical indicators such as EMA and RSI based on historical price data, providing valuable insights into market trends and sentiment.
Recommendation System: Incorporates recommendations from both LSTM models and technical analysis, guiding users on whether to 'Buy', 'Sell', or 'Hold' stocks.
Performance Evaluation: Compares actual and predicted prices to assess the model's accuracy, crucial for evaluating model performance and guiding investment decisions.
Usage:

Data Collection:

Obtain historical stock price data for the desired stock using tiingo api.

Model Training:
